lilyglot
========

Lilyglot is an extension for [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/) that
facilitates multilingual texts for use in header variables, instrument names,
articulations, tempo specifications, marks, TOC, etc.
A multilingual text is identified by a symbolic name. The actually used text
corresponds to the selected lilyglot language. This is independent
of the language selected for music entry.

Lilyglot requires LilyPond version 2.22.0 or higher.
